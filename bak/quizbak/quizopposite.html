<p>Yes / No (Answer 1 - Yes)</p>
 
<p>Feedback 1 - If answer is correct, provide feedback. Sid will say. “Good job!” Then move to Question 2 for user to attempt.</p>
<p>If answer is incorrect, provide feedback. Sid will say, “Try again.” Then move to Question 1 for user to attempt again. </p>

<p>
Feedback 2 - If answer is correct, Sid provides feedback: “Good job!” Then move to Question 3 for user to attempt.
If answer is incorrect, Sid provides feedback: “If the objects are travelling at the same speed, it means they cover the same distance at any time. How would this affect their meeting point? Try again.” Then move to Question 2 for user to attempt again.
</p>

<p>
Question 3 - 2 objects start moving in the opposite direction at the same time. If they move at different speeds, where will they meet? Drag the “Meeting Point” to where you think they will meet. (show the diagram below with slider for “Meeting Point”)
</p>

<p>
Feedback 3 - If answer is correct, Sid provides feedback: “Good job!” Then move to Question 4 for user to attempt.
If answer is incorrect, Sid provides feedback: “If the object on the right is travelling at a faster speed, it means it covers more distance compared to the object on the left. How would this affect their meeting point? Try again.” Then move to Question 3 for user to attempt again.
</p>
<p>
Question 4 - 2 objects start moving in the opposite direction at the same time. If the object on the right moves at twice the speed of the object on the left, where will they meet? Drag the “Meeting Point” to where you think they will meet. (show the diagram below with slider for “Meeting Point”. Include tick marks which divide the line into 12 equal segments.)

<p>Feedback 4 - If answer is correct, Sid provides feedback: “Good job!” Then move to 3.1 Menu 2.
If answer is incorrect, Sid provides feedback: “If the object on the right is travelling at double the speed, it means it covers twice the distance covered by the object on the left. How would this affect their meeting point? Try again.” Then move to Question 4 for user to attempt again.
